SpaceFortress
=============

SpaceFortress.app is an open source game, a playground for learning about OpenGL and simulations.

What?
-----

SpaceFortress is a work in progress game currently targeting OS X that purports to be an exploration game. 
Currently it isn't much more than a semi-intelligent solar system simulation, but the end goal is a traditional
4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) with some of the look and feel of Dwarf Fortress. I don't anticipate
using actual ASCII characters for graphics, or having an inconsistent keyboard-only UI, but that is what
motivated me to start this project.

Features?
---------

* completely randomized star systems
* blazingly fast 2D graphics
* planets to colonize, destroy or terraform as you see fit
* 30 frames per second at all times
* dozens of structures to build, research and expand on planets you colonize

Why???
------

Well a good answer would probably speak to my interests in learning OpenGL and developing games, but the honest
answer is that I'm completely insane. Yep, no other good reason for this project. It's open source because I believe
in passing on my knowledge to other people. 

How do I run this?
------------------
I built this with Xcode 4.6.2 targeting 10.8, but I suspect it will compile on earlier versions of Xcode targeting 10.6 
or maybe even 10.5? I'm not using many advanced features from OpenGL3 or even 2 afaik, but it would be nice to know.

What you can do
---------------
Suggest things! Try to build the project. Feel free to hack on it and send pull requests.
